#ProgrammableWeb Example Illustration on Working with Vapor & Server Side Swift

## What is Server-Side Swift?
Ever since Apple had open-sourced [Swift](https://swift.org/server-apis/) ,  the developer community saw a greater potential for the language than mere client-side iOS development, but rather envisioned a language that has the potential to become more universal, cross-platform and community-driven. One such emergence is *Server-Side Swift*, and in this article we will look at how to develop server-side Swift with [Vapor](https://twitter.com/codevapor) (@codevapor). 

### Why code your backend in Swift?
The most burning of questions is, the question of why have Swift on the server in the first place? We already have great and well-established server frameworks out there, like Node.js and Rails, so why look at something that is still somewhat experimental? 

Leveraging the same technology on your backend as on the iOS client means you can utilize the same team on both ends, adding greater knowledge transfer and knowledge redundancy, and lowering cost-of-maintenance through additional resources. 

Having a Swift back-end and front-end means you divide feature development according to features, not technology stack. One developer will own the entire registration process, one developer the entire activity feed feature. That is, you get vertical delegation rather than horizontal delegation and ownership.  

> *Swift has amazing potential on the server, and to be an even better language for server-side development Swift needs great low-level APIs common among server frameworks. The Server APIs project will provide core capabilities in areas such as networking and security so Swift programs no longer need to frequently rely on platform-specific C libraries to provide this functionality. As a result, developers will be able to create frameworks and server applications using pure-Swift code, without the need to also have systems programming skills and knowledge of multiple platforms.* (source: Swift.org)

While we are in the early days of server-side swift development, we are already starting to see three prominent Swift movements emerge.  Each of these open-source projects provide their own frameworks for setting up Swift on the server. [Perfect](http://perfect.org) was one of the first web server toolkits out there.  [Kitura](http://kitura.io) has featured on Appleâ€™s [2016 WWDC Server session](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRX1Zs7tIH0) , backed and pushed by IBM. The final framework, which will be the one we will choose for this tutorial, is [Vapor](http://vapor.github.io).
